**Update the Customer Voice Simulation module** that generates 100+ synthetic customer responses. The module should:

1. Generate a detailed 2,000-2,500 word report with these exact sections:
   * **Executive Summary** (200-300 words)
   * **Simulation Methodology**
      * Persona distribution and rationale
      * Response generation approach
      * Confidence levels in findings
   * **Persona Analysis** (4 personas)
      * Early Adopters (20%)
      * Pragmatists (35%)
      * Skeptics (25%)
      * Critics (20%)
   * **Assumption Validation Results**
      * Response analysis for each assumption
      * Validation confidence scores
      * Surprising insights discovered
   * **Key Themes & Patterns**
      * Common objections
      * Excitement drivers
      * Deal breakers
   * **Partnership Reception** (if partnership mode enabled)
      * Trust and credibility factors
      * Integration concerns
      * Value perception of joint offering
   * **Strategic Recommendations**
      * Messaging adjustments
      * Feature prioritization
      * Go-to-market insights

2. For each persona (300-400 words):
   * Demographic and psychographic profile
   * 5-7 direct quote examples that sound authentic
   * Specific concerns in their voice
   * Decision criteria and priorities
   * Price sensitivity insights
   * Competitor preferences

3. When partnership mode is enabled:
   * Focus responses on the JOINT experience (e.g., "HoneyBook + Xero integration")
   * Include concerns about data sharing between partners
   * Address trust issues with two companies handling their data
   * Evaluate perceived value of the combined solution vs. separate tools
   * Include quotes about partnership stability and longevity

4. Response generation guidelines:
   * Include specific objections with emotional context
   * Use industry-specific terminology
   * Vary response length and style by persona
   * Include unexpected use cases discovered
   * Surface non-obvious concerns

5. Create frontend preview UI (like Risk Assessment has):
   * Display "Analysis Will Include:" section
   * Show icons for: Persona Profiles, Voice Samples, Validation Scores, Strategic Insights
   * List what each persona type reveals
   * Include "Generate Customer Voices" button

6. CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - Use this EXACT format:
