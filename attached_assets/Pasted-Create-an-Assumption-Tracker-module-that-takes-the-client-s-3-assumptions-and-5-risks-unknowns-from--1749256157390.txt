Create an Assumption Tracker module that takes the client's 3 assumptions and 5 risks/unknowns from the intake form and builds practical validation strategies. The module should:

Generate a detailed 1,800-2,200 word report with these exact sections:

Executive Summary (200-300 words)
Core Assumptions Validation (3 assumptions from intake)

For each: Why it matters, How to test it, Success criteria


Key Risks & Unknowns (5 risks from intake)

For each: Impact assessment, Early indicators, Mitigation approach


Validation Roadmap by Sprint Tier

Discovery Sprint ($5K): 1 week desk research only
Feasibility Sprint ($15K): Discovery + 5 interviews + 1 demand test
Validation Sprint ($35K): Full 30-day program with 10-15 interviews + 2-3 demand tests


Recommended Testing Methods

Desk research approaches for Discovery
Interview guides and demand test options
Success metrics and decision criteria


Priority & Sequencing

Which assumptions to test first and why
Dependencies between assumptions
Go/no-go decision points




For each assumption (300-400 words):

Quote the EXACT assumption text from intake
Explain why this matters to the business model
Propose validation approach for each sprint tier
Define clear, measurable success criteria
Identify what can be learned from desk research alone
Specify what requires customer interviews or demand tests


For each risk/unknown (150-200 words):

Quote the EXACT risk text from intake
Assess potential impact (High/Medium/Low)
Identify what desk research can reveal
Note what requires primary research
Link to relevant assumptions

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[First paragraph summarizing the 3 assumptions and 5 risks]
[Second paragraph recommending which sprint tier to start with]
KEY FINDINGS:

Most Critical Assumption: [Which one and why]
Highest Impact Risk: [Which one and why]
Recommended Sprint: [Discovery/Feasibility/Validation]
What Desk Research Can Answer: [List key questions]
What Requires Customer Input: [List key questions]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CORE ASSUMPTIONS VALIDATION

Assumption 1: "[Exact text from intake]"
─────────────────────────────────────────
Why This Matters:
[Explain business impact if true/false]
Discovery Sprint Approach (Desk Research Only):

What we can learn: [Specific insights from secondary research]
Data sources: [Industry reports, competitor analysis, etc.]
Limitations: [What can't be answered without customers]

Feasibility Sprint Approach (+ 5 Interviews + 1 Demand Test):

Interview focus: [Key questions for the 5 customers]
Demand test option: [Specific test like landing page, survey]
Additional insights: [What this adds beyond Discovery]

Validation Sprint Approach (+ 10-15 Interviews + 2-3 Demand Tests):

Expanded interviews: [Broader customer segments to cover]
Multiple demand tests: [Test 1], [Test 2], [Test 3]
Statistical confidence: [What 15 interviews can validate]

Success Criteria:

Discovery: [What indicates proceed/stop]
Feasibility: [Minimum viable proof]
Validation: [Full confidence threshold]

[Repeat for Assumptions 2 and 3]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

KEY RISKS & UNKNOWNS

Risk 1: "[Exact text from intake]"
───────────────────────────────────
Impact Level: [High/Medium/Low]
What Desk Research Can Reveal:

[Available market data]
[Competitor precedents]

What Requires Primary Research:

[Customer-specific insights needed]

Mitigation Approach by Sprint:

Discovery: [Initial risk assessment]
Feasibility: [Risk validation with 5 interviews]
Validation: [Full risk mitigation plan]

[Repeat for Risks 2-5]

VALIDATION ROADMAP BY SPRINT TIER

Discovery Sprint ($5K) - 1 Week Desk Research
────────────────────────────────────────────
What We Can Validate:

Market size and competitive landscape
Industry benchmarks and best practices
Regulatory requirements and constraints
Pricing precedents and models

Deliverables:

Market sizing analysis
Competitive intelligence report
Initial assumption assessment
Go/no-go recommendation

Limitations:

No direct customer feedback
No demand validation
Assumptions based on secondary data

Feasibility Sprint ($15K) - Discovery + Light Validation
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Adds to Discovery:

5 customer interviews (target: [specific segment])
1 demand test (recommended: [specific test])
Business model simulation

What This Validates:

Initial customer interest and pain points
Basic willingness to pay
Key assumption directional validation

Decision Point: Enough evidence to invest in full validation?
Validation Sprint ($35K) - 30-Day Comprehensive Program
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Full Program Includes:

10-15 customer interviews across segments
2-3 demand tests (landing pages, prototypes, etc.)
Competitive battlecards
90-day implementation roadmap
Financial model and projections

What This Validates:

All core assumptions with statistical confidence
Demand across multiple customer segments
Competitive positioning and differentiation
Implementation feasibility

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RECOMMENDED TESTING METHODS

Desk Research Methods (Discovery):

Industry reports: [Specific sources]
Competitor analysis: [What to analyze]
Online communities: [Where target customers discuss]
Search trend analysis: [Keywords to track]

Interview Approaches (Feasibility/Validation):

Problem discovery interviews
Solution validation interviews
Pricing sensitivity discussions
Competitive alternative analysis

Demand Tests (Feasibility/Validation):

Landing page with signup
Paid ad campaign test
Prototype feedback session
Pre-order or LOI collection

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PRIORITY & SEQUENCING

Test First: [Assumption #] because [specific reason]
Test Second: [Assumption #] because [specific reason]
Test Third: [Assumption #] because [specific reason]
Sprint Recommendation:
[Recommend Discovery, Feasibility, or Validation based on:

Current evidence level
Risk tolerance
Available budget
Time constraints]

Focus on what can realistically be learned at each investment level. Be clear about the limitations of desk research and the value of primary customer research.
