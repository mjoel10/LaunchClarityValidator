CRITICAL ISSUES with the current implementation:

1. MISSING FEATURES - I only see 8 modules, but there should be 19+:
  Discovery (ALL should be unlocked for this $5k sprint):
  - Initial Intake ✅
  - AI Market Simulation ❌ (shown as locked but should be unlocked)
  - Assumption Tracker ❌ (shown as locked but should be unlocked)
  - Competitive Intelligence ❌ (shown as locked but should be unlocked)
  - Market Sizing ❌ (shown as locked but should be unlocked)
  - Risk Assessment ❌ (shown as locked but should be unlocked)
  - SWOT Analysis ❌ (shown as locked but should be unlocked)

  Feasibility features (should show but be locked):
  - Business Model Simulator ❌ (missing)
  - Channel Recommender ❌ (missing)
  - Async Interview Suite ❌ (missing)
  - Demand Test Tracker ❌ (missing)

  Validation features (should show but be locked):
  - Full Interview Suite ❌ (missing)
  - Multi-Channel Testing ❌ (missing)
  - Strategic Analysis Tools ❌ (missing)
  - Implementation Roadmap ❌ (missing)
  - 90-Day Action Plan ❌ (missing)
  - Blue Ocean Strategy ❌ (missing)
  - Partnership Evaluation ❌ (missing)

2. WRONG LOCKING - This is a Discovery Sprint ($5k paid), so ALL Discovery features should be immediately accessible, not locked!

3. GO/PIVOT/KILL DECISION ENGINE - This should be a separate prominent section that:
  - Is available for ALL sprint tiers
  - For Discovery: Uses basic data for Go/Pivot decision only
  - For Feasibility: Adds Kill option with business model and interview data
  - For Validation: Full analysis with all 19+ data sources for comprehensive recommendation
  - Shows as a special "Decision Framework" that synthesizes ALL completed modules

4. REPLACE THE INVESTMENT DISPLAY - The "$5,000 Investment" box provides no value. Replace it with the Go/Pivot/Kill Decision Engine card that shows:
  - Current recommendation (Go/Pivot/Kill/Insufficient Data)
  - Confidence level % (based on modules completed)
  - Key factors driving the decision (3-4 bullet points)
  - "View Full Analysis" button for detailed report
  
  This dynamic decision card updates as modules are completed and actually justifies the sprint investment by showing real-time strategic value.

5. Please reorganize to show:
  - ALL 19+ features in sidebar grouped by tier
  - Proper unlocking based on purchased tier
  - Go/Pivot/Kill Decision Engine replacing the investment display
  - Clear visual separation between tiers (maybe section headers)

The current implementation is broken - it's not showing all features and the locking logic is wrong.
