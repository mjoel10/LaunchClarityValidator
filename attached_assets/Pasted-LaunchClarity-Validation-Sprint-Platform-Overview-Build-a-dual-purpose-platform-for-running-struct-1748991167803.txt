LaunchClarity - Validation Sprint Platform
Overview
Build a dual-purpose platform for running structured validation sprints. The app serves consultants running sprints for clients AND allows clients to view progress and eventually self-serve. This is a FRESH BUILD, not an update to existing code.
Business Context
Three sprint tiers: Discovery ($5k/1 week), Feasibility ($15k/2 weeks), Validation ($35k/4 weeks)
Each tier is additive - Feasibility includes all Discovery features, Validation includes everything
Consultant-operated initially, but clients get portal access
Post-sprint converts to $2k/month SaaS subscription
Must support multiple concurrent sprints
OpenAI API usage is expected to be significant ($50-100 per sprint for premium analysis quality)
Validation interviews are fully outsourced via research partners (~$4-6k cost)
Technical Requirements
Use Replit's native PostgreSQL (not Firebase)
Implement proper user roles (admin/consultant vs client)
Mobile-responsive design (many clients will check on phones)
Real-time updates when consultants add data
Stripe payment integration
OpenAI API for all AI-powered analysis
User Interviews API integration for Feasibility sprint recruiting
Respondent.io API integration for Validation sprint interview management
Core User Flows
1. Client Onboarding (Most Critical)
Create a comprehensive intake form that collects necessary client information. To support structured AI analysis and reduce garbage-in/garbage-out risks, the intake form should use structured fields wherever possible. Free-text is reserved for critical GPT-required context.
Break intake into 5 sections:
Business Overview
Company name
Contact info
Business model: dropdown (B2B, B2C, B2B2C, B2G, Marketplace)
Product type: dropdown (SaaS, Service, Physical, Marketplace, App)
Current stage: dropdown (Idea, Pre-launch, MVP, Revenue < $100K, Revenue > $100K)
Industry: dropdown
Geographic markets: multi-select
Operational Complexity
Sales complexity: dropdown (Low/Med/High)
Sales motion: dropdown (Self-serve, Inside, Field, Hybrid)
Delivery complexity: dropdown (Low/Med/High)
Primary delivery model: dropdown (Digital, Physical, Service-heavy, Hybrid)
Customer + Value Prop
Target customer description: rich text
Core problem being solved: rich text
Value proposition: rich text
Estimated price point: numeric text + currency
Competitive Landscape
Top 3 competitors: list (name + differentiator)
Unique advantage: short text
Validation Intent
Top 3 assumptions to validate: free text
Primary validation goals: multi-select (Problem Fit, Solution Fit, Pricing, Channel, Model)
#1 critical question: free text
Has this been tested before? (yes/no + optional description)
Do you have an audience to test with? (yes/no)
All data saved under sprint_data.module_name = "intake" for downstream AI use.
1B. Optional Mode: Partnership Evaluation Sprints
In addition to product/service validation, LaunchClarity must support a "Partnership Evaluation" mode to test strategic collaborations (e.g. HoneyBook × Xero). This can be toggled during sprint setup.
Changes for Partnership Mode:
Additional Intake Fields
Evaluated partner: free text
Partner type: dropdown (Platform, Reseller, Tech Integration, Co-Marketing, Other)
Relationship status: dropdown (None, Early convo, Signed LOI, Beta)
Integration type: dropdown (API, White-label, Co-built, Bundled Offer)
Primary goal of partnership: dropdown (New Revenue, Churn Reduction, Market Entry, Strategic Leverage)
Key risks or uncertainties: text
AI Module Adjustments
Market Simulation: prompt GPT to generate synthetic feedback from mutual customers
Risk Assessment: includes dimensions like brand risk, integration failure, or channel conflict
Go/Pivot/Kill engine: assesses partner fit across strategic, technical, and market criteria
2. Consultant Dashboard
See all active sprints in simple list view
Quick-add data to any module
Switch between sprints easily with dropdown
View client dashboards directly
3. Client Portal

OpenAI Integration Requirements
Every AI-powered feature must:
Make real API calls (no hardcoded responses)
Use inputs from onboarding data
Generate actionable insights, not generic advice
Structure outputs for easy visualization
Handle errors gracefully
Be completely white-labeled - Never mention "GPT", "OpenAI", or "AI" in client-facing outputs
Present as "LaunchClarity Analysis Engine" or similar proprietary branding
Important: The platform will make extensive use of OpenAI's API. Expect $50-100 in API costs per sprint for premium analysis quality. Use GPT-4 as the default for all client-facing insights. This investment enables:
100+ synthetic personas for market simulation
Multiple analysis passes for deeper insights
Richer competitive intelligence and battlecards
More nuanced cross-module synthesis
Longer, more detailed strategic recommendations
Agent Simulation Prompting: For Discovery sprints, use carefully calibrated prompts to generate realistic market responses:
Prime personas for skepticism and critical thinking
Include failure scenarios and past disappointments
Force realistic distribution (30% negative, 40% skeptical, 20% interested, 10% enthusiastic)
Add context constraints (budget limits, existing vendors, risk-averse culture)
Generate specific objections, not generic concerns
Example modules needing AI:
Market Simulation (100+ synthetic responses)
Sprint timeline generator
Messaging variants creator
Interview question generator
Insight synthesizer (multiple calls for cross-interview analysis)
Channel recommender
Risk analyzer
Decision engine (comprehensive analysis)
Next steps generator
Competitive battlecards
Market sizing calculator
Business model scenario generator
SWOT synthesis across all data
Critical Success Factors
Onboarding captures enough data to generate meaningful Discovery Sprint outputs immediately
Consultants can run multiple sprints without context switching headaches
Clients feel informed and engaged without ability to break things
Payment → Sprint → SaaS conversion is seamless
Mobile experience is actually good, not just "works on mobile"
AI insights feel specific to their business, not generic
MVP Focus
Build the critical Discovery Sprint, Feasibility Sprint, and Validation Sprint features first that are mandatories to deliver the sprint experiences but the client facing side can be relatively bare-bones, overall app architecture should support all tiers from day one, but client facing and client management features can be added as needed.
What This Is NOT
Not a generic form builder
Not just PDF reports (interactive dashboards are key)
Not a one-size-fits-all tool (must adapt to sprint tier)
Not a replacement for consultant expertise (augments it)
Single Consultant MVP Simplifications
Since this platform will have only ONE consultant (me) for the first 6 months, simplify accordingly:
Simplified Features:
Simple email/password login - no complex auth system
Hardcode consultant account - no consultant signup flow
Sprint list instead of kanban view
Basic sprint switching via dropdown
No bulk operations needed
No "impersonate client" feature - just use test accounts
No consultant settings or profile management
Must Still Support:
5-10 concurrent client sprints
Full sprint management functionality
All tier features (Discovery, Feasibility, Validation)
Easy switching between active sprints
Sprint status tracking and timeline views
Focus Development Time On:
Beautiful client-facing dashboards (80% of effort here)
Smooth intake form experience
Rock-solid AI integration
Clean PDF exports
Fast, efficient data entry interface
Database Simplifications:
No consultant_id needed on most tables (only one consultant)
Simple is_client boolean for user roles
No audit trails or activity logs initially
No complex permission hierarchies
Simplicity Requirements (IMPORTANT)
Client Responsibilities:
Clients fill out the comprehensive intake form (this is critical - it powers all AI analysis!)
After intake, client portal is mostly read-only (view progress, dashboards, add comments)
Clients can update/refine their intake data if needed during the sprint
Basic Payment Flow (Keep Simple):
Consultant creates sprint → System generates Stripe payment link
Send payment link to client via email (not in-app)
Client pays → Stripe webhook updates sprint status to "active"
Client then receives intake form link
Just track: Paid/Unpaid status and payment date
One-time sprint payments: Discovery $5k, Feasibility $15k, Validation $35k
Accept credit cards and ACH transfers via Stripe
Future: $2k/month subscription (not in MVP)
What NOT to build (avoid scope creep):
No complex team management - one login per client company is fine
No in-app messaging/chat system - email communication works fine
No elaborate notification system - basic email triggers only
No client self-service signup flow - consultants create accounts and send intake links
No billing/invoice management beyond basic payment status
No complex permissions system - just consultant vs client views
No version control or change tracking - keep it simple
Core Flow to Focus On:
Consultant creates client account → generates payment link
Client pays → receives intake form link
Client fills comprehensive intake form
Consultant runs sprint (adding data, triggering AI analysis)
Client views beautiful dashboards and progress
Both can add comments, client can download PDFs
MVP Reality Check:
Build for 1 consultant initially (me)
Support 5-10 concurrent clients maximum to start
80% of effort on: intake form → AI analysis → api integrations + stunning output dashboards
20% of effort on: efficient consultant data entry
Think "intake + beautiful dashboard delivery" not "collaboration platform"
Database Simplicity:
Users table (consultants and clients)
Sprints table (with tier, status, dates, payment info)
Sprint_data table (flexible JSON for all module data)
Comments table
Keep it flat and simple - no complex relationships
Final Note
This platform should feel like a premium, full-service experience that justifies the pricing. At $35k for Validation, clients receive professionally conducted research, AI-powered analysis, and strategic recommendations - a complete "done-for-you" validation sprint. The combination of beautiful UI, intelligent AI analysis, professional research management, and seamless consultant/client collaboration should make it obvious why this costs $5-35k instead of using free tools. This platform must be flexible enough to support both product launches and strategic partnership evaluations. Whether a client is validating a new SaaS idea or considering a high-stakes B2B integration, LaunchClarity should deliver rigorous, structured clarity to inform Go/Pivot/Kill decisions.
