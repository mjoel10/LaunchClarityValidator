Restructure the Assumption Tracker to organize assumptions by sprint tier. Update the component to:

1. Change the AI prompt to generate assumptions organized by what's testable in each tier:
  "Generate assumptions for [company context] organized by validation method:
  - Discovery assumptions (5-6): Things provable via desk research in 1 week (competitor analysis, API documentation, support ticket analysis, forum research)
  - Feasibility assumptions (4-5): Things requiring 5-7 customer interviews in 2 weeks (actual time spent, specific pain points, willingness to pay, preference data)
  - Validation assumptions (4-5): Things requiring market tests/beta in 4 weeks (click rates, signup conversion, setup success, early satisfaction)
  Focus on leading indicators testable within each timeframe, not long-term metrics."

2. Restructure the UI into three sections:
  - Discovery Sprint section
  - Feasibility Sprint section
  - Validation Sprint section

3. For each section, show:
  - Header with sprint name
  - List of assumptions for that tier
  - Progress bar showing validated vs. total for that tier
  - Validation status for each assumption

4. Update the summary cards to show:
  - Discovery: X of Y validated
  - Feasibility: X of Y validated
  - Validation: X of Y validated
  - Overall progress: X of Y total assumptions validated

5. Make assumptions more specific and timebound:
  - Bad: "Users will adopt the integration"
  - Good: "30%+ of surveyed users express immediate activation interest"

6. Add validation method hints for each assumption:
  - Discovery: "Research method: Analyze competitor pricing pages"
  - Feasibility: "Interview question: Walk me through your current bookkeeping process"  
  - Validation: "Test method: Measure conversion on beta signup landing page"

7. Color code sections based on current sprint tier (highlight active tier)

This structure organizes assumptions by what's realistically testable in each timeframe and helps consultants track progress systematically.
