Based on our discussion, let's simplify the platform to a single unified experience that I'll use to run sprints on behalf of clients. Here's what we need:

UNIFIED EXPERIENCE APPROACH:
- Remove the distinction between consultant and client views for now
- Build ONE interface where I can:
  1. Create and manage sprints
  2. Fill out intake forms on behalf of clients
  3. Run all AI analysis and add data
  4. View the beautiful dashboards and reports
  5. Export PDFs to share with clients

KEY CHANGES:
1. Remove the "Client Intake Form" as a separate client-facing page
2. Instead, make it accessible from the main sprint dashboard as "Sprint Setup" or "Initial Data"
3. I'll fill it out myself during client onboarding calls
4. Remove any client login/authentication - just one admin account (me)
5. Keep all the beautiful dashboard views but assume I'm viewing them to share with clients

WORKFLOW SIMPLIFICATION:
1. I create a new sprint (selecting tier: Discovery/Feasibility/Validation)
2. I enter client company details
3. I fill out the comprehensive intake form during our kickoff call
4. I run the sprint, triggering AI analysis and adding data as needed
5. I view dashboards and export PDFs to share with clients
6. Clients receive PDF reports and screen shares during calls (no login needed)

WHAT TO KEEP:
- All tier-based features (Discovery, Feasibility, Validation)
- The comprehensive intake form (but as part of my workflow)
- All AI-powered analysis features
- Beautiful dashboard visualizations
- PDF export functionality
- Sprint progress tracking
- The modern UI design we just implemented

WHAT TO REMOVE/SIMPLIFY:
- Client authentication/login system
- Separate client vs consultant views
- Client portal concept
- Comment system (I'll track notes elsewhere)
- Complex permissions

FOCUS ON:
- Making data entry efficient for me as the operator
- Ensuring AI analysis runs smoothly with intake data
- Creating stunning visualizations I can share
- Quick sprint switching between my 5-10 concurrent clients
- Professional PDF exports

This approach lets me start using the platform immediately for real clients while we validate the core functionality. We can always add client self-service features later once we understand the workflow better.
