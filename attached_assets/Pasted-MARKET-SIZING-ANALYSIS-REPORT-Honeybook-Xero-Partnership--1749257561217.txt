EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides a comprehensive market sizing analysis of the strategic partnership between Honeybook and Xero. The partnership aims to streamline accounting processes for Honeybook's creative professional user base by integrating Xero's accounting software. This analysis will cover the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) for the partnership, assess the revenue opportunities, and explore the customer overlap and integration adoption rates. The focus is on the potential revenue from the integration, the efficiency gains for users, and the strategic benefits for both companies.

1. TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET (TAM)

The Total Addressable Market represents the total revenue opportunity available if the partnership between Honeybook and Xero could capture 100% of the market. For this analysis, TAM is defined as the entire user base of Honeybook who could potentially benefit from integrating Xero's accounting software.

• HONEYBOOK USER BASE: Honeybook has over 50,000 users. However, the partnership specifically targets those who actively use accounting software, approximately 35,000 users (70% of the total user base).

• REVENUE POTENTIAL: The pricing model for the integration is set at $15 per month. Therefore, the annual revenue potential from the entire addressable market can be calculated as follows:

  Annual Revenue = Number of Users × Monthly Price × 12
  Annual Revenue = 35,000 users × $15 × 12 = $6,300,000

2. SERVICEABLE AVAILABLE MARKET (SAM)

The Serviceable Available Market is the segment of the TAM that the partnership can realistically target and service with its current capabilities. For Honeybook and Xero, this includes users who are not only using accounting software but are also likely to adopt the integration due to the inefficiencies and errors they currently face.

• TARGET USERS: The partnership targets established creative professionals who earn $100K+ annually and currently face bookkeeping inefficiencies. This includes tax-conscious photographers, event planners, and creative agencies.

• EFFICIENCY GAINS: The integration aims to save these users 5-8 hours monthly on bookkeeping reconciliation and reduce transaction errors, which occur in 15% of cases.

• ADOPTION RATE: Assuming a conservative adoption rate of 50% among the target users, the SAM can be calculated:

  SAM Users = 35,000 users × 50% = 17,500 users

• REVENUE POTENTIAL: The annual revenue from the SAM is:

  Annual Revenue = 17,500 users × $15 × 12 = $3,150,000

3. SERVICEABLE OBTAINABLE MARKET (SOM)

  SOM Users = 17,500 users × 30% = 5,250 users

• REVENUE POTENTIAL: The annual revenue from the SOM is:
  Annual Revenue = 5,250 users × $15 × 12 = $945,000
