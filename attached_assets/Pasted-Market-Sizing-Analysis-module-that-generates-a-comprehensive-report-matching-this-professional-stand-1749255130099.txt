Market Sizing Analysis module that generates a comprehensive report matching this professional standard. The module should:

Generate a detailed 2,000-2,500 word report with these exact sections:

Executive Summary (200-300 words)
Total Addressable Market (TAM) with subsections:

Market Characteristics (user base, revenue stage, key segments, current challenges)
TAM Calculation with clear formula presentation


Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

Target user identification and rationale
SAM Calculation with assumptions


Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Realistic adoption rate analysis
SOM Calculation with first-year projections


Customer Overlap and Integration Adoption (for partnerships)

Overlap analysis
Adoption dynamics with specific pain points and time/cost savings


Revenue Opportunity

Pricing strategy justification
Multi-year revenue projections


Partnership-Specific Market Dynamics (if applicable)

Competitive landscape analysis
Strategic advantages


Actionable Insights and Recommendations

Marketing and outreach strategies
User education and support plans
Continuous improvement roadmap




Use professional formatting:

Bold section headers
Numbered subsections (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
Clear mathematical formulas using LaTeX-style notation
Specific percentages and dollar amounts
Bullet points for key characteristics


Include specific calculations:

TAM = Total Users × Monthly Pricing × 12
SAM = Target Users × Monthly Pricing × 12
SOM = SAM × Adoption Rate
Show all numbers clearly (e.g., '$3,150,000' not just '3.15M')


For partnerships, emphasize:

Integration benefits and synergies
Time savings (e.g., '5-8 hours monthly')
Error reduction rates
Specific user segments who benefit most


Maintain consultant-quality language throughout, avoiding generic statements and including specific, actionable insights.
