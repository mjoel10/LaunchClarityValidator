2. Simple UI:
   - Header: "Market Sizing Analysis" with "Run Analysis" button
   - Empty state: "Click 'Run Analysis' to generate your market sizing report"
   - Report displayed as formatted HTML optimized for copy/paste

3. When "Run Analysis" is clicked, call OpenAI API with intake data to generate:
