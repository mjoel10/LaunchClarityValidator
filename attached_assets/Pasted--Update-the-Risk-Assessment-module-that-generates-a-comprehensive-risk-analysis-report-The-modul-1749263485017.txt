**Update the Risk Assessment module** that generates a comprehensive risk analysis report. The module should:

1. Generate a detailed 2,000-2,500 word report with these exact sections:
   * **Executive Summary** (200-300 words)
   * **Risk Assessment Methodology**
      * Risk scoring framework
      * Probability and impact definitions
      * Risk tolerance thresholds
   * **Category Risk Analysis** (6 categories)
      * Market Risks
      * Technical/Product Risks
      * Financial Risks
      * Operational Risks
      * Competitive Risks
      * Regulatory/Compliance Risks
   * **Partnership Risk Factors** (if partnership mode enabled)
      * Risks for Client Company
      * Risks for Partner Company
      * Mutual/Shared Risks
   * **Risk Priority Matrix**
      * Top 10 risks ranked by severity
      * Visual heat map description
      * Critical path dependencies
   * **Mitigation Strategies**
      * Preventive measures
      * Contingency plans
      * Early warning indicators
   * **Risk Management Roadmap**
      * 90-day risk reduction plan
      * Resource requirements
      * Success metrics

2. For each risk category (250-350 words):
   * Identify 3-5 specific risks
   * Probability rating: High (>70%), Medium (30-70%), Low (<30%)
   * Impact rating: High/Medium/Low with dollar impact where possible
   * Root cause analysis
   * Mitigation tactics with owners and timelines
   * Residual risk after mitigation

3. Risk scoring methodology:
   * Risk Score = Probability × Impact (1-25 scale)
   * Include both inherent and residual risk scores
   * Flag any risks above tolerance threshold (score >15)
   * Create early warning indicator system

4. For Partnership Mode (when enabled), analyze risks from BOTH perspectives:
   * Client Company Risks: Partner dependency, revenue share, support burden, brand association, technical lock-in
   * Partner Company Risks: Integration quality, resource allocation, market cannibalization, reputation
   * Mutual Risks: Misalignment, communication breakdown, market timing, competitive response
   * Include probability/impact from both viewpoints
   * Joint mitigation strategies
   * Success criteria for both parties

5. CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - Use this EXACT format:

RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT
[Company Name] Validation Sprint Risk Analysis

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[First paragraph summarizing overall risk profile and top concerns]

[Second paragraph highlighting critical mitigation priorities]

KEY FINDINGS:
- Critical Risks (Score >15): [Number] risks identified
- Highest Risk: [Risk name] - Score: XX/25
- Total Mitigation Investment: $XXK - $XXXK
- Risk Reduction Timeline: XX days
- Success Probability: XX% with mitigation

1. RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

Framework Overview:
[Explanation of risk scoring approach]

Risk Tolerance Levels:
- Critical (Score 20-25): Immediate action required
- High (Score 15-19): Priority mitigation needed
- Medium (Score 8-14): Monitor and manage
- Low (Score 1-7): Accept or monitor

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. CATEGORY RISK ANALYSIS

Market Risks
────────────

Risk 1: [Specific risk name]
- Probability: High (XX%)
- Impact: $XXK - $XXXK revenue impact
- Score: XX/25
- Root Cause: [Detailed explanation]
- Mitigation: [Specific actions with timeline]
- Residual Risk: XX/25 after mitigation
