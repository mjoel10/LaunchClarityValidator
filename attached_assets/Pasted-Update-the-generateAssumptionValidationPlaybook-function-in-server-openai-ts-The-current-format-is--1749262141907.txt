Update the generateAssumptionValidationPlaybook function in server/openai.ts. The current format is too confusing. Restructure the prompt to create a cleaner, more actionable report:

Change the OpenAI prompt to:

"Generate a clear, scannable Assumption & Risk Validation Playbook that shows SPECIFIC insights each module will deliver for the client's assumptions and risks.

Format requirements:
1. Remove all checkmarks (✓) - they're misleading
2. Use clear headers without emojis
3. Be SPECIFIC about deliverables, not vague promises
4. Show concrete examples of what they'll learn

Structure like this:

ASSUMPTION & RISK VALIDATION PLAYBOOK
[Company Name] - How We Validate Your Specific Assumptions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW EACH MODULE VALIDATES YOUR ASSUMPTIONS

Your Assumption 1: [Their exact assumption text]

MARKET SIZING ANALYSIS will reveal:
- Specific market data point (e.g., 'Xero has 22% market share in creative sector')
- Relevant trend (e.g., 'QuickBooks declining 5% yearly among photographers')
- Validation insight (e.g., 'Your 30% assumption may be optimistic')

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE will show:
- Which competitors offer what (e.g., '3 of 5 competitors are QuickBooks-only')
- Pricing benchmarks (e.g., 'Xero integrations charge $12-18/month premium')
- Market gaps (e.g., 'No competitor offers bi-directional sync')

CUSTOMER VOICE SIMULATION will provide:
- Sentiment percentages (e.g., '65% prefer QuickBooks due to familiarity')
- Specific concerns (e.g., 'Learning curve is #1 objection to switching')
- Price sensitivity (e.g., 'Resistance above $18/month')

[Continue for each relevant module with SPECIFIC, not generic insights]

For Feasibility/Validation sprints, show what ADDITIONAL validation each tier adds:

FEASIBILITY ADDS:
- 5 real customer interviews revealing: [specific insight types]
- 1 demand test showing: [what it measures]

VALIDATION ADDS:
- 10-15 interviews providing: [statistical confidence level]
- 2-3 demand tests proving: [market validation metrics]

Focus on SPECIFIC insights and data points, not generic promises. Make it scannable and actionable. Show them exactly what intelligence they'll gain about their assumptions."
